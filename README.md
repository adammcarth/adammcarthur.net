### My Ghost Powered Blog

![Adam McArthur Website](http://imgkk.com/i/nrys.jpg "http://adammcarthur.net")

This is a repository for my website located at [http://adammcarthur.net](http://adammcarthur.net).

The blog is powered by a relatively new blogging platform called [Ghost](https://ghost.org/), which runs on node.js. It's unique design is credit to [Kevin Jannis](https://github.com/KevinJannis)'s awesome work.

You're more than welcome to make a contribution if you would like to. Same process as usual - fork this repository, make your changes and send in a pull request outlining your changes. Note that most files that power the website have been hidden from this public repository, either for security purposes or they are not worth being kept in version control (eg - Ghost framework files, node modules and databases).

This website is hosted on Amazon EC2, and media is delivered via Amazon S3.
