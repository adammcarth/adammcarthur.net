### My Ghost Powered Blog

![Adam McArthur Website](http://imgkk.com/i/nrys.jpg "http://adammcarthur.net")

This is a repository for my website located at [http://adammcarthur.net](http://adammcarthur.net).

My blog is powered by a relatively new blogging platform called [Ghost](https://ghost.org), which runs on Node.js. The design builds on top of an original idea by [Kevin Jannis](http://www.kevinjannis.com).

Big shout out to [David Lanham](http://davidlanham.com). He's the original designer of many Facebook sticker packs, including the Baach sheep character featured on this website. David was good enough to send me some of his designs. Don't be fooled by the fleece - this sheep is *all* attitude.

### Contributing

You're more than welcome to make a contribution if you would like to. Note that this is just the theme for my blog - core ghost files have been left out.

1. Checkout a new branch, eg: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
2. CD to this theme folder in terminal
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `grunt` initially, and then again after making changes to any CSS/JS files
5. Commit and send in a pull request outlining your changes

If you want to preview your changes, [download ghost](https://ghost.org/download) and load this theme into your own blog. Theme folders live in `/content/themes`. Ghost is started locally by running `npm start` in the Ghost installation root directory.
