### Assets

Javascript and CSS files here are minifed, respectively, into one file using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com). If you add a Javascript or CSS file, append the filename to the list in `Gruntfile.js`, located one directory back.

If you make changes to any Javascript or CSS, you will need to run `grunt` in terminal to recompile the assets and see your changes.
